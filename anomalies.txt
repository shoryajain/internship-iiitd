I found following anomalies in this data

1. Routes_short_name is missing
2. Arrival_time == departure_Time for all cases. But in reality, a bus will stop at particular stop for few seconds depening upon number of people wishing to board the bus and thus that should be taken into consideration.
3. Some data missing from stop code 108Down
4. No stops for route 264,271,272,79,370
5. There are some values for attribute route_id which has value in trips but no route with that id exists in routes. These values are 0,1,2
